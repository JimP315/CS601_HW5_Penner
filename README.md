#This was run through Glitch and essentially has an event listener, onclick function and with some styling a nice table is built from JSON data about past study I have done. 
It is pretty straight forward and you simply run this through a live server site such as Glitch or there are many other live server sites including from Git and you can style this uup. 
There is mostly html as well as the building of the table through a fetch and promise coding.
